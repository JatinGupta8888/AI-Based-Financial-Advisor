# Finance Specialist Large Language Model (LLM)

## Overview
This project involves fine-tuning Meta's open-source **Llama 3** model to create a **Large Language Model (LLM)** specializing in the field of finance. The primary objective is to develop a tool that finance professionals and enthusiasts can use to solve problems and perform various tasks in real-world financial contexts.

The project encompasses all stages of fine-tuning, including:
- Data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Model training.
- Evaluation and testing.

The development process follows an iterative approach to continuously enhance the model's performance and expand its capabilities.
